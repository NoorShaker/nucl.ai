            </div>

            <p>The nucl.ai Conference is made of three parallel tracks, each in its own room.</p>
            
            <h3>Main Amphitheatre</h3>

            <img src="{{ '/img/venue/amphi-left.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>
            <p>The primary conference room hosts over three hundred people, and will feature high-profile presentations about popular games/simulations, inspiring techniques, and innovative independent projects. This is a great platform for sharing new insights and methods, or inspiring the next generation of developers!
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Inspiring Keynotes</li>
                <li>Behind-The-Scenes Post Mortems</li>
                <li>High Profile Applications</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>The usual length for these talks is about 45 minutes including Q&A, though the schedule is flexible to special cases.</p>

            <h3>Masterclass Room</h3>

            <img src="{{ '/img/venue/amphi-right.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>
            <p>The secondary amptitheatre fits one hundred seats, and will host more in-depth tutorials and deep dive masterclasses — targeting both beginners and experienced developers.  This room is ideal for teaching new ideas or how to use libraries, to connect directly with developers and get friendly feedback.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginner Tutorials</li>
                <li>Deep Dive Masterclasses</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These talks usually go in chunks of 25 minutes, depending on the amount of content. The exact time will be decided after your proposal is accepted.</p>

            <h3>Open Laboratories</h3>

            <img src="{{ '/img/venue/room-lobby.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}"/>
            <p>The open labs are setup in a section of the lobby, a very friendly and welcoming environment with low stress. It's the ideal place to do hands-on work, give demonstrations, discuss common problems and resolve them.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hands-On Workshops</li>
                <li>Problem Solving Clinics</li>
                <li>Poster Sessions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The workshops last around 1h30 and are very interactive: they may include some presentation slides, but mostly hands-on work with the lab attendees.  Posters will be displayed throughout the conference, though official slots will be scheduled too.</p>
