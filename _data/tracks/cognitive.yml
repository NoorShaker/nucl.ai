- title: "Four Pillars to Building a Solid Conversational Bot"
  description: >
    Recently, bots have been making the headlines as the new apps: conversation will play an important role in the next interface between humans and machines. Recast.AI is a collaborative platform allowing developers to create and deploy conversational agents on any channel. In this talk, Paul will approach four major problematics he faced while developing Recast’s bot framework: modeling a conversation, understanding natural language, finding and extracting keywords, and generating language. His presentation will tackle the entire process of bot creation, from it’s global implications to its core technicalities.

- title: "Seq2Seq: Learning Pattern & Responses with Recurrent Neworks [Workshop]"
  description: >
    In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn about and experiment with Sequence To Sequence transformations using recurrent neural networks. In particular, you'll see how LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) work in practice to generate text, and how they can be used to model Seq2Seq.  You'll be provided with sample data from social media, specifically Twitter posts and their responses.  Whether you want to learn more about recurrent neural networks, predicting sequences, or just building cool and funny social media bots.
