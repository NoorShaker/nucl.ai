#  description: >
#    For decades, our books, movies and television programmes have portrayed a vision of a future where we can interact with our computers naturally, using our own languages like English. But this still isn't the reality for our day-to-day interactions with most computers. Why do our computers still not understand us?
#    Dale will talk about why this is taking so long, and describe his work as a developer on the IBM Watson project: IBM's latest attempt to move us a little closer towards this vision of computers able to understand questions from people in natural language.  He will explain the architecture behind Watson, and describe the way that Watson answers questions - how it tries to extract the meaning behind a question and uses this to identify and evaluate specific answers. 
#    Watson became better known when it was entered into the US television game show Jeopardy in 2011. Dale will show how Watson has changed since then, and some of the ways the technology has been put to use since.

- title: "Four Pillars to Building a Solid Conversational Bot"
  description: >
    Recently, bots have been making the headlines as the new apps: conversation will play an important role in the next interface between humans and machines. Recast.AI is a collaborative platform allowing developers to create and deploy conversational agents on any channel. In this talk, Paul will approach four major problematics he faced while developing Recast’s bot framework: modeling a conversation, understanding natural language, finding and extracting keywords, and generating language. His presentation will tackle the entire process of bot creation, from it’s global implications to its core technicalities.
