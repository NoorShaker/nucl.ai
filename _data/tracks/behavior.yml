- title: "Late to the Party! A Story of Adding Player Bots to a Humans-Only Game"
  description: >
    Paragon is the latest MOBA game from Epic Games. Late in production a decision has been made to add player bots to support single-player and practice matches. The talk is going to describe how adding reasonable bot players to a game build around human players has been achieved. The approach taken consisted of both using stock UE4 AI parts as well as creating performant, game-specific AI subsystems, so there's going to be something interesting for everybody!

- title: "Functional Reactive Programming, or the art of Time Travel(ling Debuggers)"
  description: >
    In 2012, Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" showed the ideal future of debugging: time travel. Being able to scrub through all the past states of your program, fix the bug, hot-reload the code and see the change applied to all the past states as well.
    Since then, only one implementation of it has appeared, for Elm, a Functional Reactive Programming language.
    FRP makes Time Travelling debuggers much cheaper to implement, making them viable for actual game development.
    In this talk we'll look at how to use FRP and time travelling debuggers to make agent-based games.

- title: "Introduction to BeHavior Language (Evolution of practical BT application)"
  description: >
    Behaviour Trees(BT) is a convenient pattern for implementing agents coordination logic. There are 2 common approaches for BT representation, either using a visual nodes builder or a specialised programming language. We are proponents of the latter. In our opinion, BT declarative syntax can be both expressive and powerful.
    In order to simplify BT coding we developed a specialised BeHaviour Language(BHL). BHL is a typed language which allows to mix both declarative BT style with familiar imperative programming style. In fact, BHL just adds a thin imperative gluing layer over a BT pattern. Apart from having a clear syntax BHL also helps to get rid of some drawbacks adherent to BT.
    This talk will include not only an introduction to BHL but also our usage experience alongside with best practices, tips and tricks.
