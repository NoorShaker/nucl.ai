#  description: >
#    Ambient characters are part of many current game titles. Yet, the intrinsic necessity and difficulty to model interactions of these characters with the environment and with each other is not easily overcome. The well-known smart object semantics introduced in The Sims has been widely adapted for its flexibility and scalability. However, classic smart objects lack the ability to deal with multiple characters, and thus are not adequate to fully bring characters to life.
#    We present an interaction-centric approach, in which smart objects instruct multiple characters by means of adaptive scripts formulated based on STRIPs-like rules. Instead of inferring possible world-states as is done in planning, the rules are used to communicate changed attitudes and circumstances between characters via a blackboard. The resulting scripting language constitutes a simple yet powerful way to express multi-character interactions situated in the environment.
#    This approach has been employed to model ambient interactions in Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae and is being extended for Final Fantasy XV. Drawing examples from this game, we show the flexibility and expressiveness of the resulting scripting system.

- title: "Late to the Party! A Story of Adding Player Bots to a Humans-Only Game"
  description: >
    Paragon is the latest MOBA game from Epic Games. Late in production a decision has been made to add player bots to support single-player and practice matches. The talk is going to describe how adding reasonable bot players to a game build around human players has been achieved. The approach taken consisted of both using stock UE4 AI parts as well as creating performant, game-specific AI subsystems, so there's going to be something interesting for everybody!

- title: "Functional Reactive Programming, or the art of Time Travel(ling Debuggers)"
  description: >
    In 2012, Bret Victor's talk "Inventing on Principle" showed the ideal future of debugging: time travel. Being able to scrub through all the past states of your program, fix the bug, hot-reload the code and see the change applied to all the past states as well.
    Since then, only one implementation of it has appeared, for Elm, a Functional Reactive Programming language.
    FRP makes Time Travelling debuggers much cheaper to implement, making them viable for actual game development.
    In this talk we'll look at how to use FRP and time travelling debuggers to make agent-based games.
