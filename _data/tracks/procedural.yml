- title: "Seq2Seq: Learning Pattern & Responses with Recurrent Neworks [Workshop]"
  description: >
    In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn about and experiment with Sequence To Sequence transformations using recurrent neural networks. In particular, you'll see how LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) work in practice to generate text, and how they can be used to model Seq2Seq.  You'll be provided with sample data from social media, specifically Twitter posts and their responses.  Whether you want to learn more about recurrent neural networks, predicting sequences, or just building cool and funny social media bots.
