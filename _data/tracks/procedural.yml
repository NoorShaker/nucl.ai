- title: "Image Synthesis with Convolutional Neural Networks [Workshop]"
  description: >
    In this hands-on workshop, you'll learn about and experiment with algorithms that use convolutional neural networks to generate images: from photo-realistic textures, to style transfer on portraits, or even up-sampling pixel art. You'll learn about the underlying neural architectures,
    how they are trained, and how you can modify them to get the results you want too!
