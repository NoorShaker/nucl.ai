- title: "A Brief History of Matchmaking in Heroes of the Storm"
  description: >
    <p>Matchmaking is a perennial problem for competitive game design. Conceptually the problem is simple: assemble two teams of players to create a fun match. In practice there are a wide range of challenges. How do you create fair match ups? How do you model player skills? What do you do for new players? What metrics help track the health of a matchmaking system?</p>
    <p>This talk will cover several of the core iterations of the Heroes of the Storm matchmaking system. We'll cover the ways matchmaking has worked, the problems we've encountered, and the solutions we've developed to address these problems. Along the way we'll cover some of the simulations and data-driven models we've developed to deliver high-quality matches to Heroes of the Storm players.</p>
