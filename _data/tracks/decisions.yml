#- title: "Drivatar and Machine Learning Racing Skills in the Forza Series"
#  description: >
#    The Forza Drivatar technology powering games in the Forza Horizon and Forza Motorsport series
#    is based on machine learning. It enables gameplay beyond robotic drivers and ghost replays by
#    learning player- and style-specific Drivatars that can compete with friends.  This presentation
#    will go behind the scenes in the development of Forza Drivatar, explaining the approach from a
#    technical perspective as well as the design and integration with the gameplay.

- title: "The How and Why of Server Validation for Mobile Simulation Games"
  description: >
    First we will discuss the how and the why of simple mobile simulation game economy, something that you 
    might find in every farming game. Then, we will spice it up with some real time decision making and how 
    it influences the challenge of server validation. We will have a look at how reusing code on server and 
    client, by implementing deterministic simulations, can make our life much easier. We wrap it up with an 
    extreme example where an economy and a battle is based on real time simulations. Expect to see technical 
    details about efficient data serialisation, how to implement deterministic simulations and much more.

- title: "Attacking Walled Cities in Total War: Warhammer"
  description: >
    A city siege battle is a complex machine of roles, responsibilities, and reactions on a large scale, 
    involving armies of hundreds or even thousands of individual men. This talk will cover the AI 
    architecture used in Total War: Warhammer to deal with the inherent complexities of this particular 
    battle type. We will cover the general Battle AI architecture before diving deep into specific examples 
    of the attacking Siege Battle AI. Finally, we will share some hard-earned development advice for AI programmers.
