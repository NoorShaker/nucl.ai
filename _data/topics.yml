    <p>Applying analytics to game design is not about driving by looking in the rear view mirror while ranting about KPIs.  Analytics can be used to apply real-time or just-in-time intelligent design judgement to the logic of who sees what when,  and to the multidimensional dynamic challenges of balance and matchmaking.   Our experts explain their creative analytical solutions to a variety of challenges in game design and experience design, across a variety of platforms and genres.   Our goal is to give you some knowledge you can take home and apply.   Come join the fun!</p>

    With the advent of virtual reality and its requirement for more immersive characters,
    as modern hardware provides more computation and memory than ever before, and thanks
    to easily available motion capture data, character animation is changing rapidly.
    How can we best combine procedural techniques with very sparse number of keyframes
    for prototyping? What techniques help leverage the large quantities of animation data
    that are now available at reasonable costs? Where can extra computation power be of
    most use at runtime?  If you're a developer building simulations, exhibits or games
    that rely heavily on animated characters, this track is intended for you!
